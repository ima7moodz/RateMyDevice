## About RateMyDevice
**RateMyDevice** is a web application built using Django that allows users to add new devices they have purchased and provide reviews. Users can rate their devices from 0 to 5 stars, write descriptions, and share their experiences with others. 

### Key Features:
- Users can **add a new device** with its details.
- Users can **edit or delete** their posted devices.
- Other users can **like** a device post and **add comments** to it.
- Users who did not post the device can **chat** with the owner for more details.
- All users can **view their activity**, including their added devices and chat history.
- **Future Work**: Implementing email notifications to inform users when their device's warranty has expired.

### Why We Built It
We created RateMyDevice to provide a community-driven platform where users can share and gain insights about different devices. This helps potential buyers make informed decisions based on real user experiences.
